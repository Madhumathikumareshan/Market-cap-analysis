# Market Cap Trends of the Magnificent 7 Tech Companies

This Power BI project explores the historical market capitalization of the "Magnificent 7" tech companies Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, and Nvidia from the year 2000 onwards.
The goal was to understand how these companies have grown in value over time and compare their market dominance across decades.
As part of my learning journey, I created this Power BI project to deepen my skills in data modeling, DAX, and dashboard design.

I'm a final year undergrad in Artificial intelligence and Data science. 
Also an aspiring data and business analyst who’s just getting started in the world of analytics. I’m curious by nature and love digging into data to find patterns,
uncover insights, and turn them into something meaningful. This project is one of my first steps into using tools like Power BI and Excel to explore real world business questions.
I'm passionate about learning, building things that add value, and growing every day  whether it's by improving a dashboard, asking better questions,
or understanding how data shapes decisions.
